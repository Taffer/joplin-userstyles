# joplin-userstyles

Styles for rendered notes in the [Joplin app](https://joplinapp.org/).

Joplin's a great note-taking application that lets you store your notes
where you want, fully encrypted. For me, it was the best alternative to
Microsoft's OneNote when I switched to Linux on my laptop.

I don't really like the way it renders notes though, and I couldn't find any
documentation on what CSS the note renderer supports, so here we are.

## Contents

* `template` - A blank CSS template with all (?) of the elements that appear
  in the Joplin Markdown renderer.
* `userstyle-onenote` - A `userstyle.css` that mimics elements of OneNote's
  WYSIWYG renderer.
