# joplin-userstyles

Styles for rendered notes in the [Joplin app](https://joplinapp.org/).

Joplin's a great note-taking application that lets you store your notes
where you want, fully encrypted. For me, it was the best alternative to
Microsoft's OneNote when I switched to Linux on my laptop.

I don't really like the way it renders notes though, and I couldn't find any
documentation on what CSS the note renderer supports, so here we are.

## Contents

* `template` - A blank CSS template with all (?) of the elements that appear
  in the Joplin Markdown renderer.
* `userstyle-onenote` - A `userstyle.css` that mimics elements of OneNote's
  WYSIWYG renderer.

## Donations

Want to add your lovely `userstyle.css` here so people can find it easily?
Here's what I'd like:

* Your `userstyle.css`.
* A description of the style.
* A screen shot of the style in action. (Optional, for when I add screen shots
  demonstrating the styles to this page.)

If you want your `userstyle.css` to be covered by a different license, that's
totally fine, include the relevant info _inside a comment_ or provide a link in
a comment, and I'll point it out as an exception in the [License] section here.
